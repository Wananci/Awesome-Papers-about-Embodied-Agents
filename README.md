# Introduction

Embodied agents are AI-driven systems designed to interact with the physical or virtual world through a body or avatar, enabling perception, action, and communication. These agents combine sensory inputs (e.g., vision, speech) with cognitive processes to perform tasks, simulate human-like behaviors, or engage in immersive interactions. They are widely used in robotics, virtual assistants, and gaming for more natural and context-aware interactions.
